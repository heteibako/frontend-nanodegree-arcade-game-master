===============================

##Description:

This game is my 5th project for the Udaicty Front-End Web Dev Nanodgree.
The goal is to create a classic arcage frogger game using the newly acquired skills in Object Oriented JS and HTML5 Canvas.


##How to Play:

Use the arrow keys to move the player across the board. To win you need to reach water, but avoid colliding with the bugs.
